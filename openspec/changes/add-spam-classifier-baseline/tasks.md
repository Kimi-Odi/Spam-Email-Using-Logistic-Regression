## Phase 1 — Baseline (Logistic Regression)
- [x] 1.1 Set up environment and dependency list (requirements.txt)
- [x] 1.2 Implement dataset fetcher for CSV URL and local cache
- [x] 1.3 Clean/normalize text (handled via TF-IDF lowercase/strip accents)
- [x] 1.4 Vectorize with TF-IDF (configurable ngram range, min df)
- [x] 1.5 Split data reproducibly (train/test; fixed random seed)
- [x] 1.6 Train baseline Logistic Regression classifier
- [x] 1.7 Evaluate (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) and print report
- [x] 1.8 Persist model artifact and vectorizer for later inference
- [x] 1.9 Provide a CLI/script entrypoint to run training and evaluation

## Phase 2 — Future (Placeholders)
- [ ] 2.x To be defined (e.g., logistic regression comparison, hyperparameter tuning, better preprocessing, deployment)
