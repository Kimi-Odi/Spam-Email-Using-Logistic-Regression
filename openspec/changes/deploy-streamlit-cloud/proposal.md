## Why
Make the SMS spam visualization accessible via the web and reproducible by others by deploying to Streamlit Cloud from a GitHub repository.

## What Changes
- Prepare the repository for Streamlit Cloud deployment (runtime, config, README)
- Ensure the app runs without local setup and can fetch the dataset
- Include prebuilt artifacts so full UI is available immediately

## Impact
- Affected specs: `deployment`
- Affected files: `runtime.txt`, `.streamlit/config.toml`, `README.md`, `artifacts/*`
